## üö® The Problem

Coastal communities in India are on the front lines of climate change, facing increasing threats from cyclones, storm surges, erosion, and pollution. Current early-warning systems are often:
- **Siloed:** Data sources are disconnected, preventing a unified view of threats.
- **Slow:** Manual analysis delays crucial alerts, costing precious evacuation time.
- **Ineffective:** Alerts often fail to drive coordinated action, leading to chaos, economic damage, and loss of life.

## üí° Our Solution: CTAS - Threat Detection System

CTAS is a comprehensive, AI-driven resilience platform that moves beyond simple alerts. We don't just detect threats; we manage the entire response lifecycle‚Äîfrom AI-powered prediction and community preparedness to smart, coordinated evacuation and resource management.

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Features
- **Unified Threat Dashboard:** A real-time geospatial dashboard visualizing data from IMD, INCOIS, and other sources on an interactive map.
- **AI-Powered Threat Detection:** Machine learning models analyze sensor and satellite data to detect anomalies and classify threats (cyclones, floods) automatically, providing maximum lead time.
- **Multi-Channel Alert System:** Disseminate alerts via SMS (Twilio), mobile push notifications (Firebase), and web dashboards to ensure they reach everyone, from fisherfolk to authorities.

### Unique & Winning Features
1.  **Smart Evacuation Routing & Resource Mapping:**
    - **Solves:** Post-alert chaos and inefficient resource allocation.
    - **How:** During an alert, the system calculates optimal evacuation routes to the nearest shelters, avoiding predicted flood zones. It also provides authorities with a real-time view of shelter capacity and resource (food, water, kits) levels.

2.  **Gamified Preparedness Drills & Community Verification:**
    - **Solves:** Community complacency and lack of ground-truth data.
    - **How:** A mobile-friendly interface allows communities to participate in monthly mock drills, earning points and badges. During real events, users can provide one-tap "ground truth" verification (e.g., "Flooding here?"), turning citizens into a vital sensor network.

### Future Enhancement Roadmap
- Integration of satellite imagery AI to detect algal blooms and illegal dumping.
- Federated Learning model for a decentralized, buoy-based sensor network.
- Blockchain-based audit trail for alerts and actions to ensure transparency.
- AR mobile app for visualizing evacuation routes in the real world.

## üß† Our AI Models

We employ a multi-model strategy for precision:
1.  **Anomaly Detection:** An `Isolation Forest` model trained on historical data to flag unexpected sensor readings.
2.  **Threat Classification:** A `Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)` model trained on historical alert data to classify incoming data into specific threat levels and types.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nereid-platform.git
    cd nereid-platform
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

4.  **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and populate your API keys for Twilio, Supabase, etc.

## üìã Usage

1.  **View Dashboard:** Open `http://localhost:3000` to see the live dashboard.
2.  **Simulate a Threat:** Use the admin panel to trigger a mock cyclone alert.
3.  **See the Flow:** Watch as alerts are generated, evacuation routes are calculated on the map, and mock SMS notifications are sent.
4.  **Try a Drill:** Open the mobile view and click "Start Drill" to experience the gamified preparedness system.
